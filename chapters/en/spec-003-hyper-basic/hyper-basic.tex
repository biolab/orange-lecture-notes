We can also visualize hyperspectral data sets. In the \textit{Datasets} widget you will find “Liver cirrhosis” data. Connecting to a \textit{Data Table}, you will see that each spectrum contains information (in meta variables) about image positions (map\_x and map\_y). \mutation\ can recognize the image positioning features from the file automatically. Otherwise, you could set them manually in the image Menu under the \textit{Axis x} and \textit{Axis y} options.

By default, the image is the 2D representation of the whole integral of each spectrum. To change  it, move the red lines on the spectrum plot. With the dropdown menu on the left panel you can select other representations.
