\newthought{At the end of a lesson}, your workflow may look like this:
\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=65mm]{saving-fig1.png}%
  \caption{\textbf{\textsf{A fairly complex workflow that you would want to share or reuse at a later time.}}}
  \label{fig:saveing-fig1}
\end{figure}

You can save this workflow using the File/Save menu and share it with your colleagues. Just don't forget to put the data files in the same directory as the file with the workflow.

Widgets also have a Report button in their bottom status bar, which you can use to keep a log of your analysis. When you find something interesting, just click it and the graph\marginnote{\textbf{\textsf{Clicking on a section of the report window allows you to add a comment.}}} will be added to your log. You can also add reports from the widgets on the path to this one, to make sure you don't forget anything relevant.

You can save the report as HTML or PDF, or a report file that includes all workflow related report items that you can later open in Orange. In this way, you and your colleagues can reproduce your analysis results.
