\chapter{Word Enrichment}

We already know a lot about our model, but wouldnâ€™t it be great to see where it was right and were it was wrong? The \widget{Confusion Matrix} widget can do exactly that!\marginnote{To observe a particular misclassification, click on a cell in the matrix.\\
\\
To output all the misclassified documents, use 'Select Misclassified'. This will output selected documents for further inspection.}

The matrix has correctly predicted documents in the diagonal (blue) and incorrectly predicted documents in off-diagonal (red). We can see that no Animal Tales were wrongly predicted as Tales of Magic, but 4 Tales of Magic were incorrectly predicted as Animal Tales.

But why? What is so different about these documents, that the model failed to predict the right class?

We can reuse \widget{Corpus Viewer} to inspect the misclassified documents. Or even better, observe which words are significant in each subset!

Word Enrichment compares a subset of documents against the entire corpus and finds statistically significant words for the selected subset.

For correctly classified Animal Tales, \emph{wolf} is a significant word representing those documents.\marginnote{Word Enrichment works on any kind of subset. In Corpus Viewer, browse for documents containing the word \emph{queen}. Now pass this subset to \widget{Word Enrichment}. Don't forget to connect \widget{Bag of Words} as well - Word Enrichment needs the entire data set against which to compare the subset.} For correctly classified Tales of Magic, the list is much longer and contains words such as \emph{king}, \emph{beautiful}, \emph{man}, etc. These results are very similar to what we have observed in a Nomogram. This is indeed just a different way of inspecting the model!

So the next time you see the word \emph{wolf} in a text, you can bet the text is an animal tale! :)
