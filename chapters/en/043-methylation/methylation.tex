\chapter{Prediction of Biological Age}
\label{ch:methylation}

Enough painting. \marginnote{\textbf{\textsf{Download the methylation data set from \url{http://file.biolab.si/datasets/methylation.pkl.gz.} Predictions of age from methylation profile were investigated by Horvath (2013) Genome Biology 14:R115.}}} Now for the real data. We will use a data set that includes human tissues from subjects of different ages. The tissues were profiled by measurements of DNA methylation, a mechanism for cells to regulate gene expression. Methylation of DNA is scarce when we are young and gets more abundant as we age. We have prepared a data set where the degree of methylation was expressed per gene. Let us test if we can predict the age from the methylation profile - and if we can do this better than by just predicting the average age of subjects in the training set.

This workflow looks familiar and is similar to those for classification problemsâ€”-the \widget{Test and Score} widget reports on statistics we have not seen before.\marginnote{\textbf{\textsf{Using other learners, like random forests, takes a while on this data set. But you may try to sample the features, obtain a smaller data set, and try various regression learners.}}} MAE, for one, is the mean average error. As for classification, we have used cross-validation. Mean average error was computed only on the test data instances and averaged across ten cross-validation runs. The results indicate that our modeling technique misses the age by about five years, which is a much better result than predicted by the mean age in the training set.
